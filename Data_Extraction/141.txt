Omnichannel e-commerce platforms are also the rage.\n3.\u00a0The Scope of marketing analytics:\nJust like data analysis can give specific insights, the overall scope of Marketing Analytics can be put in a nutshell by these functions.\nAssessing marketing campaigns:\u00a0Marketing Analytics tools provide precise information about campaign performance along with determining areas of improvement if any and predicting how they would perform in the future.\u00a0\u00a0\nCompetitor assessment:\u00a0Tools help to understand if the competitor campaign is doing better and why it is doing better.

For example, marketing analytics can lead to better\u00a0supply and demand planning,\u00a0price optimization, as well as robust lead nurturing and management, all of which leads to more revenue and greater profitability. By more effectively managing leads and being able to tie those leads to sales \u2013 which is known as closed-loop marketing analytics \u2013 you can see which specific marketing initiatives are contributing to your bottom line.\nConclusion\nIn the realm of marketing, primary research has traditionally focused on quantitative or qualitative methodologies to provide customer insights. With advances in technology, especially data mining, marketing analytics has become an invaluable tool and should be viewed as an equal component of the marketing research toolkit. Analytics requires marketers to use data to understand customers at every touch point throughout their lifecycle with the business. To do this the analyst must mine, analyze, interpret, and present the information so that it is converted into actionable intelligence. In this process, the customer\u2019s information DNA is tracked, segmented, modeled and then acted upon. As these concepts and tools become standard operating procedures, marketing departments must internalize analytics into their overall curriculum in order to provide Company with a compelling competitive advantage."
