    "Article_Text": "As the coronavirus spreads around the world and countries implement containment measures, energy supply and demand is being disrupted. The impact that country-wide lockdowns and demand slowdowns will have on energy markets will be evolving every day.\n\n\n\nImpact on energy markets are:\n\n\n\ni)Slump in wind expansion may support German power prices:\n\n\n\nThe recent slump in German wind capacity is likely to continue this year as complicated regulations and weakness in the global economic outlook due to the coronavirus are likely to dampen investment in the renewable technology.\n\n\n\nThis has the potential to restrict future additions to wind output, impacting supply and, in turn, supporting power prices.\n\n\n\nii)Chinese industrial gas demand remains weak in March:\n\n\n\nChinese natural gas demand from the industrial sector in March\u00a0was down by almost 25%\u00a0year on year, according to the Chongqing Gas and Petroleum Exchange released over Easter, as the impact of the coronavirus continued to weigh on consumption.\n\n\n\niii)Reduced energy offtake likely to hit UK suppliers:\n\n\n\nA growing number of British energy suppliers could be at risk of colllapsing\u00a0through reduced energy offtake and cash-flow constraints amid the coronavirus pandemic, according to industry sources polled by ICIS.\n\n\n\niv)Breakdown of European power demand impact\u00a0:\n\n\n\nPower consumption\u00a0continued to soften\u00a0across key European demand centres through March and the first week of April, while less stringent measures and colder weather has sheltered other parts of Europe.\n\n\n\nv)Brexit set to ensure EU 2020 renewable goals:\n\n\n\nWhile the coronavirus outbreak is already having a significant impact on the European renewables sector, one unintended consequence of the pandemic is likely to be the\u00a0achievement of EU and member state binding renewable energy targets for 2020. This is due to the consequences of a prolonged downturn in demand, which will not be normalised for by the EU\u2019s official statistics office (Eurostat), meaning that renewables look set to make up a higher share of consumption in 2020 across the EU.\n\n\n\nvi)Spanish prices stay bearish but premium to France to persist:\n\n\n\nSpanish power prices across the curve are expected to maintain a bearish trajectory\u00a0throughout the nationwide coronavirus lockdown\u00a0period which was recently extended until 26 April, with further extensions possible.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, forecasts for below-average wind generation would support Spanish spot prices,\u00a0allowing France to continue exporting power to Spain. This in turn should keep Spanish near-curve contracts at a premium to their French equivalents.\n\n\n\nvii)Coronavirus hits truck-loaded LNG demand:\n\n\n\nMarket sources have indicated the coronavirus has reduced\u00a0demand for truck-loaded LNG\u00a0around Europe, as countries have implemented lockdown measures and low oil prices have made gas less competitive as a transport fuel.\n\n\n\nData from terminals in northwest Europe shows the impact has not been as significant as originally thought.\n\n\n\nviii)Europe has found a coronavirus electricity demand floor:\n\n\n\nElectricity consumption has leveled out\u00a0in Germany, France and Italy, after falling for several weeks due to restrictions aimed at stemming the spread of the coronavirus.\n\n\n\nBut in Great Britain and Spain, demand has continued to drop week on week in recent days, according to an ICIS model that controls for the impact of temperature across Europe\u2019s five largest consumers of electricity.\n\n\n\nix)European power and carbon markets affected by COVID-19 \u2013 an early impact assessment:\n\n\n\nIn order to assess\u00a0the fundamental impact of COVID-19 on European power and carbon markets we modelled a scenario in which we accounted for the first data on dropping electricity demand as well as assumed industry production cuts and continued travel restrictions.\n\n\n\nx)India defers on LNG cargoes as lockdown ramps up:\n\n\n\nIndia buyers are deferring LNG cargoes\u00a0as ports close operations with strict lockdowns in place. This is a concern for sellers in a long market with India one of the key buyers.\n\n\n\nxi)EU to reach 2020 renewables goals on coronavirus, Brexit:\n\n\n\nThe combination of Brexit and lower demand associated with the coronavirus pandemic should enable the EU as a whole as well as many member states to\u00a0reach their 2020 renewable targets, according to ICIS model run.\n\n\n\nxii)European power markets yet to hit coronavirus demand floor:\n\n\n\nEuropean power demand will continue to drop\u00a0as governments escalate measures to stem the spread of the coronavirus.\n\n\n\nElectricity consumption in Italy and France fell 16% below expectations over the past seven days, according to an ICIS model that controls for the impact of temperatures.\n\n\n\nThree other major power markets studied by ICIS \u2013 Germany, Spain and the UK \u2013 have seen smaller drops, although all are trending down.\n\n\n\nxiii)Virus demand hit to wipe 9% off 2020 European power prices:\n\n\n\n\u2022 Power demand drop likely\n\n\n\n\u2022 ICIS model indicates 6% drop in demand during 2020\n\n\n\n\u2022 Price fall of 9% across Europe\n\n\n\nA scenario where power demand drops one-tenth through up to June as a result of measures taken to slow the spread of the coronavirus would see power prices\u00a0across European markets\u00a0fall by an average 9% in 2020.\n\n\n\nxiv)Weather-driven NBP prompt upside possible in week 13:\n\n\n\n\u2022 Temperatures across NW Europe to tumble in week 14\n\n\n\n\u2022 British local distribution zone demand to increase\n\n\n\n\u2022 EAX-NBP premium gaining\n\n\n\nIncoming cooler weather across Britain for week 14 could encourage buying across\u00a0NBP prompt and near curve contracts\u00a0in the coming sessions. The drop in temperatures will likely trigger a spike in heating demand which has also increased due to large numbers of people working from home to curb the spread of the coronavirus.\n\n\n\nxv)Southeast Europe braced for falling demand, bankruptcies:\n\n\n\nEastern European and Turkish energy companies are\u00a0braced for sharp drops in demand and potential bankruptcies\u00a0as countries introduce emergency measures in a bid to contain the coronavirus outbreak.\n\n\n\nAlthough the spread of the virus is not as extensive in this region as in Italy or Spain, the impact of the emergency measures that have been taken is likely to be felt acutely because national economies are fragile.\n\n\n\nxvi)Europe on course for sharp reduction to power demand:\n\n\n\nPower sector demand across key European countries is\u00a0set for a major slump\u00a0over the coming weeks as countries scale-up their efforts to tackle the spread of the coronavirus.\n\n\n\nDemand in Italy, which has been hit the hardest by the outbreak, has dropped 10% compared to its five-year average for March during the second week of its nationwide lockdown.\n\n\n\nAs measures to tackle the spread of the virus intensifies across other European countries, a similar drop in demand can be expected, although changes are unlikely to be uniform.\n\n\n\nxvii)China\u2019s city gas demand steady despite coronavirus, uncertain elsewhere:\n\n\n\nThe impact of the coronavirus in China has reduced but gas demand will still end March well down from 2019.\u00a0City-gate gas demand has been firm\u00a0but the outlook for other sectors remains a concern.\n\n\n\nxix)European gas centres set for April demand destruction:\n\n\n\n\u2022 EU-wide demand\u00a0crunch could follow\u00a0after lockdowns intensify\n\n\n\n\u2022 Residential demand to see brief increase before falling on warmer temperatures\n\n\n\n\u2022 LNG sellers could struggle to deliver into Europe\n\n\n\nxx)Coronavirus effects to ripple in Mexico:\n\n\n\nMexico\u2019s economy has perhaps\u00a0never been more exposed\u00a0to the global supply chains and commodity markets hit by the shocks of the coronavirus and the oil price war, but its president is losing time engaging in denial and political pandering. These will not help his party\u2019s 2021 election prospects if the country\u2019s economic performance falls further as its currency takes a beating amid capital flight.\n\n\n\nxxi)China\u2019s gas demand rebounds \u2013 satellite data:\n\n\n\nEmissions of nitrogen dioxide are on the rise in China. This is an indication that economic activity is rising as\u00a0businesses and industry ramp up activity\u00a0with the coronavirus impact subsiding.\n\n\n\nxxii)Spanish virus to impact LNG imports:\n\n\n\nSpain is home to one third of Europe\u2019s LNG import capacity, so a lockdown has the potential to\u00a0further gum up the global LNG supply chain if, as seems likely, it leads to a drop in demand for gas and a reduced ability to support scheduled imports.\n\n\n\nxxiii)European nuclear plant operators gear up to ensure power supply:\n\n\n\nEuropean nuclear power availability is\u00a0expected to remain robust\u00a0with strict safety measures already being implemented by the major plant operators amid the coronavirus outbreak.\n\n\n\nxxiv)Bulgarian power traders call for nuclear maintenance change:\n\n\n\nBulgaria\u2019s free energy market association ASEP has\u00a0called for measures\u00a0to tackle national power market disruption due to the coronavirus outbreak on 16 March.\n\n\n\nxxv)Global market moves feed energy downside jitters:\n\n\n\nHeightened concerns surrounding the economic fall-out from the coronavirus is set to\u00a0further weigh on European energy markets, traders say.\n\n\n\nxxvi)Coronavirus likely to lower trader appetite for risk:\n\n\n\nWidespread remote working due to the coronavirus is set to\u00a0hit European natural gas and power liquidity, according to traders.\n\n\n\nA number of firms have already asked traders to work from home or are expected to do so.\n\n\n\nWhile some trading activities around gas and power dispatching need to be done from a trading floor, most other tasks can be done from home.\n\n\n\nHowever, traders indicated it is unlikely to be business as normal with participants increasingly risk averse away from an office environment.\n\n\n\nxxvii)Italian gas demand plunges on coronavirus restrictions:\n\n\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak took a toll on\u00a0Italian gas demand\u00a0in week 11 as the government extended nationwide restrictions against the spread of the virus.\n\n\n\nIf restrictions continue, demand and gas prices are likely to fall further as warmer temperatures follow spring, pressuring consumption for heating. Power prices are also expected to plunge on the back of weaker gas. Gas is Italy\u2019s main source for power generation and the marginal fuel, therefore a price maker for Italian power.\n\n\n\nxxviii)Expect weakness in Chinese summer gas demand:\n\n\n\n\u2022 Coronavirus\u00a0impact on LPG to worsen\n\n\n\n\u2022 China\u2019s big three will have sought some LNG volume deferrals as another means by which to deal with the mounting oversupply\n\n\n\n\u2022 Incremental demand for gas and LNG this summer will be unusually low\n\n\n\nxxix)Coronavirus fails to pull down Italian power demand significantly:\n\n\n\nThe Italian wholesale electricity market has so far\u00a0avoided major losses\u00a0following the outbreak of the Coronavirus in the country, the strongest so far across Europe."
