People from all over the world are travelling in and out of ChinaItaly itself a tourist and business hub, the man in Delhi who tested positive for coronavirus had travelled to ItalyOther countries get the virus because of the movement of people and goods\n\n\n\nCorona Virus Has Halted The Movement Of People, Goods, Service, And Capital.\n\n\n\nMore than a fifth of the world\u2019s population has been under lockdown in the global fight against coronavirus with early sign of success.\n\n\n\nDue to Supply Chain Break Down In China because of Coronavirus\n\n\n\nCountries Providing Incentives To Shift Production To Their Native Country\n\n\n\nAmid Covid-19 World Trade Has Halted, Investors Are Pulling Out Money from The Market\n\n\n\nOther Side Of The Coin!!\n\n\n\nCorona Virus Won\u2019t End Globalization, But Change It Hugely for The A Better\n\n\n\nWill Hutton\n\n\n\nAn unregulated world can be blamed for its spread, but collective action based on evidence could be the best way to stop it.\n\n\n\nTrade During Coronavirus:\n\n\n\n1.India Readies list of 13 countries to send hydroxychloroquine.\n\n\n\n2.China Sends doctors and masks overseas domestic coronavirus infection drop.\n\n\n\nMovement of Ideas\n\n\n\nCountries are converging virtually to share best practice to fight pandemic\n\n\n\nInternational meeting such as G-20, SAARC summit organized virtually\n\n\n\nLiving apart, we must stand together\u2019 to battle coronavirus pandemic-UN Rights chief.\n\n\n\nChina\u2019s BRI Project after COVID-19\n\n\n\nBRI Project:\n\n\n\nThe Belt and Road Initiative is a global development strategy adopted by the Chinese government in 2013 involving infrastructure development and investments in nearly 70 countries and international organizations in Asia, Europe, and Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurtailed Connectivity after Covid19:\n\n\n\nA devastating economic collapse of potentially historic proportions after Covid19, leading to social and political turmoil in a number of countries, and curtailed connectivity. Interestingly, the pandemic has exposed the risks and weaknesses of global interconnectedness, which will affect China\u2019s BRI.\n\n\n\nFunding Shortfall for BRI\n\n\n\nSo far, BRI has been powered primarily by China, whose growth rates were decreasing even before the outbreak. Exports Hit: With the United States and Europe reeling from the pandemic, Chinese exports will take a big hit.\n\n\n\nChina confronts major Risk of debt on belt and road due to pandemic\n\n\n\nChina\u2019s growth hit a near 30-year low of 6.1%\n\n\n\nRoughly 5 Million people in china lost their jobs in the first 2 months of 2020.\n\n\n\nLast February, China\u2019s official urban unemployment jumped to an unprecedented 6.2 percent. Unemployed Number may go up to 9 million by the end of 2020.\n\n\n\nChina will have to choose out of two competing priorities:\n\n\n\navoiding the middle-income trap,while at the same time posturing as a superpower abroad.\n\n\n\nSo, not only may BRI be short of cash, but it will also be hard to sell at home\n\n\n\nAll Economies along BRI routes affected\n\n\n\nPakistan, host to the biggest BRI megaproject in the world, is poised to sustain a $8.2 billion loss, according to ADB. The respective figure for Bangladesh is $3 billion. Thailand is now bracing up for a recession. Africa is equally vulnerable, as China is the continent\u2019s largest market.\n\n\n\nCovid19 hit Chinese companies executing BRI contracts can rely on support from the CDB in the form of low-cost financing. Yet, Chinese policy banks will be increasingly picky and inclined to stay away from new projects that may turn out to be loss-makers.\n\n\n\nChina Development Bank to support Belt and road companies hit by coronavirus -Xinhua\n\n\n\nThe Coronavirus and Xi Jinping\u2019s Worldview\n\n\n\nPriority list:\n\n\n\nNo. 1 preserving the CCP\u2019s power\n\n\n\nNo. 2 maintaining national unity\n\n\n\nNo. 3 the expansion of the economy No. 4 environmental sustainability\n\n\n\nNo. 5 modernize the Chinese military\n\n\n\nNo. 6 China\u2019s 14 neighboring states\n\n\n\nNo. 7 weaken America\u2019s longstanding security alliances No. 8 terrestrial Silk Road Economic Belt No. 9 Maritime Silk Road\n\n\n\nNo 10 reshape the global order\n\n\n\nUnder extreme circumstances, Beijing will not consider the BRI as important.\n\n\n\nIs the BRI Finished then? Short Term: Yes, BRI will Face Trouble\n\n\n\nIn particular, the summer of 2020 may be a period of hibernation for several BRI projects.\n\n\n\nThe outbreak has brought Chinese labor supplies and equipment imports along BRI routes down to a trickle\n\n\n\nNot Exactly!!! In fact, the initiative\u2019s fuzzy content is being further enriched with the \u201cHealth Silk Road\u201d add-on narrative and \u201cmask diplomacy\u201d in a major soft-power push.\n\n\n\nLong Term: A Changed BRI will Emerge\n\n\n\nThe BRI is bound to change. Strategies will change.\n\n\n\nIt might even be Defined Properly\n\n\n\nSeven years after this ambitious initiative was announced it remains a blurred vision in need of a comprehensive conceptual framework, international standards, and a coherent implementation strategy.\n\n\n\nThis is one of the reasons why the BRI has become controversial and has caused a backlash in many countries.\n\n\n\nA Shift away from Roads and Bridges\n\n\n\nBRI expenditure up to 2019 stood at $545 billion. (WB Estimate) About two-thirds of spending on BRI projects has gone into the energy sector and transport\n\n\n\nHowever, developing countries in need of infrastructure will be terribly cash-strapped, there may be a shift away from roads, bridges, and coalfired power plants funded through Chinese loans.\n\n\n\nNew BRI projects will probably be more strategically chosen. \n\n\n\nBeijing has been investing in the creation of a globe-spanning network of economic corridors, logistics zones, and financial centers, with stress laid on seaports and adjacent areas. Egypt\u2019s Suez Canal Economic Zone and Sri Lanka\u2019s Colombo Port City clearly show this trend.\n\n\n\nIn addition, projects are likely to focus on more sophisticated forms of connectivity, such as 5G networks or, in the wake of the pandemic, disaster management, public health-related high-tech, and even remote surgery. China will surely use the BRI for the projection of its soft power, an increasingly important battlefield in international relations.\n\n\n\nThe world has become aware of the risks of overwhelming reliance on China.\n\n\n\nAmid of Coronavirus outbreak we can see the major economies are strengthening their authorities with their major concern\n\n\n\nThe USA is conducting space miningChina\u2019s maritime AggressionIndia USA $155 Million Defense Deal, US Approves sale of Anti-Ship Missiles and torpedoes to India."
