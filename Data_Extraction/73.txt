Since the rise of AI-infused technology like Amazon\u2019s Alexa or Apple\u2019s Siri, voice search has grown increasingly popular. In fact, nearly\u00a060 percent of people all over the world\u00a0use voice search at least once a day.\n\n\n\nAs this technology grows more popular and complex with each passing day, business owners are starting to take notice of voice search. Capitalizing on this trend is only possible when optimizing the content on your website for voice search. Are you trying to make your website more voice search-friendly? If so, check out the following tips.\n\n\n\n1. Accuracy of voice search\n\n\n\nIn the past, if you wanted relevant answers from a voice recognition technology, well\u2014good luck with that. But today, machine learning systems can compete with people in terms of accuracy. Google\u2019s voice recognition, Google is now able to understand human language with 95 percent accuracy. These improvements mean that, while you can trust good voice systems to match customers with the right products, services, or information with increasing degrees of nuance, leading businesses already have set customer expectations for delivery. Thanks to machine learning algorithms that can detect speech and respond with meaningful results.\n\n\n\n2. The interest in voice is only going to grow\n\n\n\nBecause voice search systems are at a point where they actually can perform reliably and meet customer expectations just as well (if not better) than traditional query options, customer trust in them is growing:\n\n\n\n60% of 18-to-49-year-olds\u00a0talk to automated voice systems at least once a day.Voice shopping\u00a0is expected to reach $40 billion by 2022\u2014up from $2 billion in 2018;\u00a0global smart speaker sales\u00a0expected to exceed $30 billion by 2024.30% of people\u00a0who don\u2019t have a voice assistant would like to buy one.50% of smart speaker owners\u00a0would like to get information about deals, sales, and promotions.\n\n\n\nYet, only\u00a04% of businesses\u00a0are properly optimized for voice search. What\u2019s with the disconnect? In other words, business leaders are at an ideal intersection where reliable systems are available and there are still many customers who haven\u2019t been reached or who might want more out of the systems they currently use. Bringing those systems and customers together will help companies avoid being left behind.\n\n\n\n3. People are after convenience and all types of information\n\n\n\nWhen people use voice search, they don\u2019t just want to locate a great pair of shoes or a TV.\u00a0People want all kinds of other information, such as your store hours, how to connect to support specialists, and when you\u2019re having your next sale. This is partly why some experts have predicted a \u201ctotally different internet\u201d within the next five to 10 years, one where voice-activated chatbots have all but replaced the e-commerce channels we\u2019re used to using. \n\n\n\nShoppers are also after general tips that can take some of the friction out of everyday life\u2014think life hacks and how-tos. In fact, words like \u201chow,\u201d \u201cwhat,\u201d \u201cbest,\u201d and \u201ceasy\u201d are among the top voice search queries. This means that when it comes to online marketing, you probably need to change your entire optimization approach, taking elements like grammar and semantics, the structure of your site, and structured data markup that influences Google\u2019s ability to find your content. Of course, optimizing from the start, not as an afterthought, is ideal.\n\n\n\n4. How Voice become part of customer-brand interactions \n\n\n\nVoice Search can be used on both desktop and mobile searches. We can see that customers want different types of information from voice systems, they also can use it at many points in the customer journey. For example, about half of shoppers use voice to research products, even \u201cnear me\u201d searches results are mostly done by customers.\u00a0Customers also use voice to:\n\n\n\nAdd items to shopping lists (36%)Track packages (30%)Make a purchase (22%)Give a rating or review (20%)Contact support (18%)Reorder something (17%)\n\n\n\nThese statistics show you should think beyond just having customers find you or your products. Voice search and commands can take your buyers from start to finish, so give your customers as much convenience and satisfaction as possible by integrating voice options into more types of interactions.\n\n\n\n5. Voice is often just the starting point\n\n\n\nA\u00a0survey\u00a0showed that, once a consumer makes a local voice search, their next most common action is to call the business (28%). Customers also are highly likely to visit company websites (27%), show up at the company\u2019s location (19%), and do more research into that business or additional businesses (14% and 12%, respectively). So, in short, while voice services can allow a customer to complete many steps without human interaction, you shouldn\u2019t see it as a total substitute. Many people are going to take further steps after the initial search, and they still will want to hear a human voice respond back once in a while. They are going to have more questions, and they\u2019re willing to physically connect with you and what you offer. Don\u2019t drop the ball in other areas, like making your site aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate, having enough staff ready to chat, listing an accurate contact number, or keeping your store well-stocked. Voice search already is shifting the way customers engage with brands, but there\u2019s still time for companies of any size to get involved with voice systems in ways that can benefit both the customer and the business\u2019s bottom line. The next step is to find voice search solutions. However, as with other technologies, these are not necessarily one size fits all, meaning it\u2019s critical to shop around and be specific about your goals. If you can customize and update your options in a scalable way, they\u2019ll be even more effective for your business."
