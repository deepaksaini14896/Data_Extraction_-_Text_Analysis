Older\u00a0age people and those with underlying medical\u00a0problems\u00a0like\u00a0cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.\n\n\n\nThe best way to prevent and slow down transmission is\u00a0well informed about the COVID-19\u00a0 virus,\u00a0 the disease it causes and how it spreads.\u00a0 Protect yourself\u00a0and others from\u00a0infection by\u00a0washing\u00a0your\u00a0hands\u00a0or\u00a0using\u00a0an alcohol-based\u00a0rub frequently and not touching your face.\n\n\n\nThe\u00a0 COVID-19\u00a0 virus spreads\u00a0primarily through droplets of saliva or discharges from the nose when an infected person suffering from coughs or sneezes, so it is important that you also practice respiratory etiquette\u00a0 (for example,\u00a0 by coughing into a flexed elbow).\n\n\n\nAt this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for this virus. However, there are many ongoing clinical trials calculating potential treatments. Which will continue to provide regular basis information as soon as clinical findings become available\n\n\n\nIMPACT\n\n\n\nThe emergence of COVID-19 is a tragic public-health emergency. The disease, one hopes, will be brought under control quickly, but the International Monetary Fund is already warning that economic growth in\u00a0 China may slow.\u00a0 As we watch the situation unfold, three broader risks to the global economy are also becoming more apparent and clear.\n\n\n\nThe first risk is obviously in China itself. While the precise\norigins of the disease remain unclear, it is hard to take a definite view on\nwhether outbreaks of this kind could be avoided \u2013 for example, by better\ncontrol over hygiene in food markets. But it is painfully obvious that a lack\nof transparency in China has contributed to fear and even signs of panic around\nthe world.\n\n\n\nAs financial markets go down in 2007-2008, when the precise incidence of big risks is not well understood, people tend to assume the worse. Rapidly falling asset prices may not contain much information\u2013except that there is not much information to be had.\n\n\n\nThe Chinese\nauthorities surely do not have all the answers at this point, but their\ninclination to suppress data and interpretation is tremendously unhelpful.\n\n\n\nSecond, the lack of American leadership is more painfully apparent every day. The United States has the strongest medical-health system and facilities in the world, with the capacity for research and development\u00a0 (government and private)\u00a0 that is second to none.\u00a0 Yet\u00a0 President\u00a0 Donald\u00a0 Trump\u2019s administration seems to be concerned primarily with playing down the risks while keeping the virus out of the United States of America \u2013 a nearly impossible task.\n\n\n\nThe private\u00a0sector\u00a0is\u00a0working\u00a0hard\u00a0on a\u00a0 vaccine,\u00a0 and\u00a0this is\u00a0commendable. Unfortunately,\u00a0 over a\u00a0 longer period of time,\u00a0 the lack of a\u00a0 consistent market for such vaccines has undermined investment in this sector. By creating the world\u2019s largest market for many drugs, the US effectively supports research across a wide range of ailments \u2013 but only those for which there is large and steady demand in the US.\n\n\n\nEven the most fervent believer in\u00a0 Trump\u2019s\u00a0 \u201cAmerica\u00a0 First\u201d\u00a0 must be willing to concede that it is not in America\u2019s interest for the rest of the world to become sick. These are US allies, friends, and customers. Also, like it or not, few diseases will stop at\u00a0 America\u2019s borders.\u00a0 Indeed,\u00a0 the\u00a0 US\u00a0 Centers for\u00a0 Disease\u00a0 Control and Prevention (CDC) has said that the question is not if, but rather when, COVID-19 spreads domestically.\n\n\n\nThe third risk is in emerging markets and developing countries. Poorer countries are ill-equipped to deal with this kind of disease,\u00a0 as seen in\u00a0 African countries\u2019 refusal to airlift their citizens from China.\n\n\n\nThe news that\u00a0the\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0has reached\u00a0 Italy has\u00a0shaken world financial markets,\u00a0 but\u00a0 Italy is a\u00a0 relatively well-organized and rich country. A\u00a0vibrant democracy ensures that people will quickly understand if containment and treatment measures are working.\n\n\n\nWe should be much more concerned about other countries,\u00a0where nutrition is worse, housing standards are weak, and disease transmission can occur much more readily. If these countries\u2019 health systems come under pressure, the US, Europe, and others should step up quickly with technical assistance and essential supplies. But here, too, there is so far a worrying lack of leadership.\n\n\n\nIt seems unlikely that this disease will prove to be as deadly as some of those that our ancestors experienced. Medical practice and public health have advanced a great deal.\u00a0The\u00a0 CDC\u00a0 is an outstanding organization,\u00a0 and the\u00a0 World\u00a0 Health Organization has a\u00a0 strong track record when the chips are down.\u00a0Private-sector groups of dedicated doctors and nurses have performed extraordinarily well under the most difficult circumstances, such as dealing with Ebola, when they are given a chance. We are fortunate to live in an age that has so many heroic people.\n\n\n\nStill, this coronavirus is a warning. Societies neglect access\nto health-care systems and reduce investments in Research and development at\ngreat peril. Diseases are always evolving, and we must continually increase our\ncapacity to understand and fight newly emerging threats.\n\n\n\nThe best way forward is by strengthening science,\u00a0training more scientists,\u00a0and building more labs. Countries that are able to do this like the US should share ideas and knowledge as widely as possible.\n\n\n\nInvesting more in science is an appealing economic proposition. Given very high rates\u00a0 of\u00a0 social\u00a0 return,\u00a0basic\u00a0 research\u00a0 across a\u00a0wide\u00a0range\u00a0of\u00a0 activities\u00a0more\u00a0 than pays for itself\n\n\n\nBut this is not about economics. More likely than not, one day a scientist will save your life or the life of a loved one because his or her previous work produced a drug, treatment, or just an idea that made a critical difference. We should invest in scientists to save ourselves and our neighbors. Also, we must remember that we have neighbors all over our deeply interconnected world.\n\n\n\nGlobal\nshares take a hit\n\n\n\nBig shifts in stock markets,\u00a0 where shares in companies are bought and sold,\u00a0 can affect many investments in pensions or individual savings accounts (ISAs).\n\n\n\nThe\nFTSE, Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nikkei have all seen huge falls\nsince the outbreak began on 31 December.\n\n\n\nThe Dow and the FTSE recently saw their biggest one-day declines since 1987.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestors\nfear the spread of the coronavirus will destroy economic growth and that\ngovernment action may not be enough to stop the decline.\n\n\n\nIn\nresponse, central banks in many countries, including the United Kingdom, have\nslashed interest rates.\n\n\n\nThat should, in theory, make borrowing cheaper and\nencourage spending to boost the economy.\n\n\n\nGlobal\nmarkets did also recover some ground after the US Senate passed a $2 trillion\n(\u00a31.7tn) coronavirus aid bill to help workers and businesses.\n\n\n\nBut\nsome analysts have warned that they could be volatile until the pandemic is\ncontained.\n\n\n\nINDIAN ECONOMY\n\n\n\nIndia faces a\u00a0sharp decline in government revenues and economic growth for at least two quarters as the coronavirus hits economic activity and a fall in investor sentiment impacts privatization plans,\u00a0 government and industry sources said.\n\n\n\nOfficially, the government is still sticking to the target of achieving 6-6.5% in the next financial year beginning\u00a0 April,\u00a0while hoping that a\u00a0 fall in crude oil prices could help it garner more revenue and contain a\u00a0 fall in revenue from other sectors but economists and bankers are turning increasingly downbeat about India\u2019s economic prospects, especially as the government is betting on filling its coffers through ill-timed asset sales. We are going to miss the revised revenue targets for the current fiscal year, and will have to lower next year\u2019s targets as well,\u201d said a senior government official with direct knowledge of budget estimates.\n\n\n\nHe said receipts from much-delayed privatization of\u00a0 India\u2019s second-biggest oil refiner, Bharat Petroleum Corp, could be lower by at least $2 billion against initial estimates. The company\u2019s share prices have fallen by over 27% since January while the broader\u00a0 NSE\u00a0 Nifty\u00a050 index has fallen by nearly\u00a0 20%\u00a0 following a\u00a0 panic in global markets.\n\n\n\nOn\nWednesday, the government suspended almost all visas to the country till April\n\n\n\n15\u00a0 to prevent the spread of coronavirus as cases across the region continue to rise. Total cases in the country rose to\u00a073\u00a0on\u00a0Thursday,\u00a0according to the government. Another senior finance ministry official said some of the proposed share-shale plans in companies like\u00a0Coal\u00a0 India,\u00a0Steel Authority of\u00a0 India\u00a0 Ltd (SAIL), NMDC and IRCON have been deferred. The government now expects to raise about Rs 50,000 crore ($6.75 billion) against the downwardly revised target of Rs\n\n\n\n65,000\u00a0 crore for the ongoing financial year ending in\u00a0 March,\u00a0the official said. Another senior official in the tax department said receipts have been hit due to a fall in consumer demand as reflected in the lower sales of autos, passenger traffic, hotel bookings, and retail sales.\n\n\n\nTour\u00a0 operators\u00a0 estimate\u00a0 January-March\u00a0 quarter earnings\u00a0could\u00a0 fall\u00a0 by\u00a0 more\u00a0 than\n\n\n\n60%\u00a0 from a\u00a0 year ago as hundreds of thousands of tourists cancel travel,\u00a0 hitting hotels,\u00a0 airlines and tax collection for the federal and state governments. India attracts nearly one million foreign tourists a month, and the travel restrictions could impact for the next few months. The situation in India was still far better compared to some other countries hit by a global pandemic, Sarkar said.\n\n\n\nIndia annually earns nearly\u00a0 $30\u00a0 billion from foreign tourist arrivals,\u00a0 and the industry is worried that a global spread of the virus will harm already weakened economic growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs this situation will take time to recover and economy not only of India but globally is in a recession it up to government how they come up with their measure.\n\n\n\nIf we look at recent action of US\u00a0FED and other countries step it took a thought that this pressure is deeper than it looks like and this situation is very different than that happen in 2008 crisis or that in 1998 as that time none of the factories are closed but this time work has been stoped and more importantly economy from past 1 year is facing slow down in many sectors so this will impact small companies badly.\n\n\n\nBut if we think in another way there will be a shift in a lot of pattern like people will now go for short term investment in the stock market due to uncertainty of life, Insurance stocks will be benefited, logistics & distribution network will totally change as factories will now try to procure material from nearest location and there will be an increase in the personal saving of people because of which automakers and real estate sector may be hit hard.\n\n\n\nIf we estimate, it will take around 1 year to get back in a track from now and all this will happen if the government and central bank continuously come up with relief measure"
