    "Article_Text": "What we can learn, is to have frequent updates to our pandemic simulations, then the simulation that shuts down the pandemic the quickest, institute immediately!\n\n\n\nThe USA has known for two years, what the implications of the virus are going to be, because in 2018, the John Hopkins Center for Health Security ran a simulation called \u201cParainfluenza Clade X\u201d to determine what the potential would be of a virus pandemic, and they concluded: \u201c\u2026twenty months 150 million people\u00a0\u00a0worldwide\u2013two percent of the global population\u2013have died.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026The global economy has collapsed under the strain, with the\u00a0Dow Jones average down 90 percent.\u00a0U.S.\u00a0GDP down 50 percent, and\u00a0unemployment at 20 percent. Washington is barely functioning\u2013the president and vice president are both ill, one-third of Congress is dead or incapacitated.\n\n\n\n\u201d\u00a0People involved in that simulation were Tom Daschle\u00a0(former leader of US Senate),\u00a0Dr. Julie Gerberding\u00a0(former head CDC),\u00a0Jim Talen\u00a0(former Missouri senator)\u2013Why are all of these people keeping quiet right now,\u00a0and not telling us what they saw in the global virus pandemic simulation only two years ago, and helping lead us out of this mess, with some new simulations???!!!\u00a0 \n\n\n\nThe most important lesson to learn is that you always need to keep a spare ventilator in your garage. Your local hospital might run out just when you need one."
