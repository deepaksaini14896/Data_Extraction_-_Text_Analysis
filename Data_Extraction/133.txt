    "Article_Text": "Data held by companies is a real treasure that reveals its value by creating new services.\n\n\n\nMonetization is about data selling but is foremost the creation of new digital products and services that are fostered by data.\n\n\n\nThese new services are the key\ndifferentiators of the most innovative companies. Service Design is the best\napproach to innovate and create new data monetization applications.\n\n\n\nA framework for data monetization\n\n\n\nToday, mega-companies such as Facebook and Google\nderive a large portion of their revenue from the effective utilization of data.\nThey have mastered the art of data monetization \u2014 turning data assets into\ncold, hard cash. These companies offer a free, public service that allows them\nto harvest massive amounts of data about their users. They then provide this\ndata \u2014 for a fee \u2014 to advertisers that want to create a personalized\nmarketing experience.\n\n\n\nHere are several potential opportunities for data\nmonetization:\n\n\n\nIdentifying new revenue opportunities (products, markets, or customer segments)Improving marketing impact through personalizationIdentifying and proactively responding to customer satisfaction levelsMinimizing customer churn and extending customer retentionOptimizing the supply chain through data sharing with partnersDiagnosing revenue leaks and instituting corrective measuresDetecting and preventing fraud and piracy\n\n\n\nStart\nto monetize your data today\n\n\n\nBut to really know if you\u2019re ready to\nmonetize, you need to access what you have before you attempt to earn revenue\nfrom your information, make sure that it is:\n\n\n\nDependableRelevantSegmentSecure and anonymized\n\n\n\nDeveloping Capability for Data Monetization\n\n\n\nBusiness models are already changing through the\nexploitation of information. To be successful in this age of data monetization,\nyou must think creatively about how you hire talent and develop leaders.\n\n\n\nThe C-suite executives who will help your business\nsucceed today, and certainly tomorrow, will be different from the people who\nled blue-chip firms 30, 20 or even 10 years ago. The route you take to data\nmonetization will have an impact on the resources and capabilities your\norganization needs to steal a march on its rivals.\n\n\n\nYou \u2014 and your people \u2014 must adapt to this second wave of big data exploitation, where insight shapes the new product and service development. If the way to make dollars is through data, then your organization and its people must make that shift. Get your capability ready now.\n\n\n\nBusiness\nModel Spectrum\n\n\n\nExternal data monetization models vary by level of value\nimpact to customers, analytics sophistication, and revenue potential.\n\n\n\nData as a service.\u00a0Also known as data\nsyndication, this is the simplest of the three business models. Anonymized and\naggregated data are sold either to intermediate companies or end customers who\nmine the data for insights. \n\n\n\nInsight as a service.\u00a0Companies also\ncan combine internal and external data sources, applying advanced analytics to\nprovide actionable insights. AkzoNobel has created a decision-support model for\nship operators to enable fuel and CO2\u00a0savings. They make\navailable to ship operators and owners an advanced analytics-enabled mobile iOS\napp that provides continuous performance prediction of coating technologies.\nThis approach empowers vessel operators by allowing financial and performance\nbenefit analysis of coating choices, thus optimizing important investment\ndecisions.\n\n\n\nAnalytics-enabled platform as a service.\u00a0This is the most\ncomplex of the three business models, and it offers the greatest value to\ncustomers. Companies use sophisticated and proprietary algorithms to generate\nenriched, highly transformed, customized real-time data delivered to customers\nvia cloud-based, self-service platforms. \n\n\n\nSetting up a\nData Factory\n\n\n\nTo maximize the potential for internal and external monetization,\ncompanies should set up a \u201cdata factory\u201d that automates the process of\ncollecting, enriching, transforming, and deriving insights from data. It\u2019s a\ncomplex undertaking requiring a set of design principles that touch on design\nthinking, lean start-up, and agile methodologies for success.\n\n\n\nCreate a data platform.\u00a0The architecture and technology stack that supports a data monetization business model typically involves a robust enterprise data strategy, and a \u201cdata platform\u201d with an intuitive interface to allow analysis, synthesis, modeling, and interaction with the data at a higher, more visual level.\n\n\n\nTurning Data\ninto a Strategic Asset\n\n\n\nAll companies are data companies, and most have a substantial amount of\nuntapped, underutilized data, which could unlock tremendous financial value.\n\n\n\nThere are three key components to complementing and even transforming a\nbusiness model with a data factory:\n\n\n\nIdentify potential internal and external\nmonetization opportunities.Appraise your data, identify any hidden\nopportunities to enrich it, and increase insight value.Develop a strong monetization strategy and\nassess business opportunities, dependencies, and capability gaps.\n\n\n\nKey areas\nwhere data monetization can impact your business.\n\n\n\nManaged Services Provision: Data gives some firms an opportunity to pivot. Take telecom businesses, which have traditionally focused on network provision. The capital expenditure associated with these core activities is high and will only increase with the launch of 5G. Smart operators are looking at their huge data assets and creating new routes to market.Mobility: Companies that have hooked into the connected automobile ecosystem are already creating valuable products and services. Insurance firms, for example, are\u00a0using telematics to monitor driver performance\u00a0and charge premiums based on behavior.Payments: Payments data comes in multiple forms. Enterprise-level information includes customer preferences, line-of-business data, and needs assessment. Supplemental data includes raw data from external sources such as social media and weather channels. The merchant ecosystem, meanwhile, provides another conduit of information.Logistics: Logistics is the world\u2019s biggest integrated system. Every movement requires a huge amount of information about flow, and smart businesses are tapping into this insight to see when the cost of movement is likely to be lowest. UPS, for example, is\u00a0using telematics and advanced algorithms to create optimal routes for delivery drivers.Health Care: New entrants recognize the potential financial gains from data monetization in health care. Experts suggest that\u00a0Alphabet has at least nine life and science companies, while Amazon is looking at opportunities to use big data to transform health care.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nVery few organizations\nhave established methods for data asset management. It is not easy to implement\nif the business is not built on data from the beginning. But it is not enough\nfor data to be used only for the purposes of monitoring and maintaining\nphysical assets. That data needs to be monetized. This, in part, is a process\nof generating new revenues from data that currently serves another purpose.\n\n\n\nThe business of data monetization is likely to evolve\nquickly. Payments providers would be well advised to begin planning their\nstrategy without delay: first-mover advantage may determine future success. A\n\u201cstart small, scale fast\u201d approach allows for flexibility, learning, and course\ncorrection as the business develops. Partnerships with complementary players in\npayments and in the digital and start-up ecosystem could be a winning factor.\nHow much value could be created is difficult to estimate at this early stage,\nbut experience in some use cases and markets suggests it could amount to\nbetween 5 and 10 percent of revenues."
