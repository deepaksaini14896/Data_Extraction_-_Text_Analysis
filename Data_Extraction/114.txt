    "Article_Text": "The business of business is no longer to do just business\nor increase the bottom line to maximize shareholder value. Rather, the concept\nof business is moving towards a new dimension of sustainable business, the\ntriple bottom line. People, planet, and profits are the core\nideologies that are rooted in sustainable business. Sustainability is taken\ninto account when companies want to create long-term value creation along with\nstrategies that promote the longevity of the company. As corporate\naccountability rises, expectations and need for transparency among stakeholders\nincreases therefore companies have started to recognize the need to be\nsustainable to stay alert and alive. \n\n\n\nBusiness\nglobalization that has happened over the previous few decades has made some\ncompanies more powerful than some national governments, making it easy for them\nto exploit inexpensive labor, plunder natural resources, causing severe impacts\nthrough pollution on the natural environment, human health, and biodiversity.\nUnfortunately for them, their horrible past has been catching up with them like\nin the case of child labor issues of IKEA & Nike, Rana Plaza accident in\nBangladesh affecting Zara, H&M and other clothing brands, environment\npollution by BP, Shell, Exxon Mobil etc. With the emergence of internet and\nsocial media these practices can no longer be covered up and silenced, the\nworld has become more educated and less tolerant and therefore with every\nmisdemeanor that is committed brand equity takes a hit. The media is fast\npicking up on cover-ups, half-truths, and bad corporate behavior and demanding\naccountability and transparency from corporates. Therefore to survive, companies\nare compelled to adopt sustainability and bring forth the rules for their\nsuppliers as well. \n\n\n\nMany\nof the irresponsible company practices and disasters that are witnessed in that\nlast couple of decades were motivated solely by short-termism- the desire\nfor instant gratification- and the appeal of short-term performance\nincentives. For instance, deferred maintenance and slack leadership were to\nblame for the 1984 leaks from the pesticide plant Union Carbide India Ltd in\nBhopal. Estimates placed more than half a million casualties from the gas\ndischarge of the plant. Finally, Union Carbide Corporation\u2019s 1989 litigation\npayout came out to today\u2019s equivalent of nearly one billion US dollars. Another\nexample where the company was forced to shut down operations was Coca Cola at\nits Plachimada plant in Kerala. The local communities faced acute water\nshortage after the commissioning of the plant and the company authorities\nblatantly ignored the community woes. These businesses stated above didn\u2019t\nrespect stakeholder engagement which ultimately lead to their untimely demise.\n\n\n\nToday\u2019s\nissues cannot be solved without participation from all stakeholders, and\ncompanies with influence should be the torchbearers of change. They need to\nengage with regulators, communities, societies, suppliers, and NGOs for\neffective and desired outcomes. Issues where engagement are required include\npopulation growth; global middle-class growth; decline in ecosystems; water\nscarcity; food safety; material resource security; higher global energy demand;\nchanges in geographic patterns of energy consumption; and increasing climate\nchange regulatory interventions.\n\n\n\nBy actively pursuing the triple\nbottom line, the essential possibilities available are:\n\n\n\nsave expenses\nby reducing environmental effects; motivate\nemployees and decreased employee turnover;decrease risk\nthrough engaging with stakeholders; create a\nreputation by improving environmental effectiveness ;\n\n\n\nIn order for companies to commit\nto sustainability they should have the below objectives in place:\n\n\n\nStrategy alignment and sustainability: management should ensure alignment between the company\u2019s strategy and its sustainability initiatives. Sometimes, there is a divergence between the two concepts making sustainability attempts to look fragile and lacking real dedication and prioritization. For example, Toyota is well known for hybrid engine development, but less so for decreasing its reliance on rare earth minerals. Toyota decreased its dependence on imports and operational risk, thus reducing its economic hazards in the event of price rises.Compliance first, then competitive advantage: Compliance must be addressed first and foremost by businesses, which often involves laws on waste management, pollution, and energy efficiency as well as human rights and labor accountability. Recent reports show that investors are shying away from compliance hazards progressively. Reactive to proactive: As a result of a crisis, many of today\u2019s leading sustainability businesses such as Nike, Coca-Cola, Telenor, IKEA, Siemens, and Nestl\u00e9 have stepped up mainly. For instance, in locations like Indonesia throughout the 90s, Nike confronted boycotts and government anger for abusive labor practices but turned the tide around. It became a pioneer in the establishment of transparency in 2005 by releasing a full list of the factories with which it contracts and a comprehensive 108-page report revealing conditions and payment in its factories. It also recognized huge problems, especially in its factories in South Asia. These businesses have all created more proactive sustainability approaches by acknowledging the effect of sustainability in a crisis.\n\n\n\nQuantify,\nincluding the company situation:\nall businesses are struggling to quantify their sustainability investment\nreturns. This is a straightforward problem with respect to compliance. \n\n\n\nTransparency\nis a precondition for assessing and enhancing sustainability practices. The only way for companies to achieve transparency is through\nopen communication with all key stakeholders based on high levels of\ninformation disclosure, clarity, and accuracy as well as an openness to\nrecognize faults and improve practices.\n\n\n\nSustainability -triple bottom line- can drive a company\u2019s achievement beyond shareholder value creation by building corporate shared value at its core and help in addressing social &environmental problems. Several investors today use ESG metrics to evaluate the ethical effect and sustainability practices of an organization. Investors are looking at variables like the carbon footprint of a company, water use, community development efforts, and diversity board before investing. Companies have started responding to investors by publishing their annual sustainability reports. Research indicates that businesses with elevated ESG scores have reduced debt and equity costs and that sustainability projects can contribute to improving economic efficiency while encouraging government assistance. It\u2019s only a matter of time, the flow of sustainability nourishes businesses in achieving holistic development for the environment, people and its profits.\n\n\n\nBlackcoffer Insights 12 | Sanjana Jose Varghese | IIM Lucknow"
