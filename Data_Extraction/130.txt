    "Article_Text": "Analytics is a statistical scientific process of discovering and presenting the meaningful patterns that can be found in data. While business analytics refers to the skills, technologies, applications, practices, computer programming and operations research for the continuous exploration of data to gain insight that drives business decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness analytics technology\u00a0is helping healthcare organizations regulate existing data to improve clinical and business operations. In addition to this, analytics help to identify the symptoms of diseases in preliminary stages itself along with suggesting possible remedies for the same without any need of the intervention of a human being. With the help of analytics and chatbots patient can now look for expert doctor advice in the comfort of their home free of charge in most of the cases with as easy accessibility as one-touch from your smartphones.\n\n\n\nAccording to\nthe survey conducted by Health Catalyst, a whopping 90% of the respondents\nadmitted that analytics is going to be either \u201cextremely important\u201d or \u201cvery\nimportant\u201d to their organization within the next few years. And the respondents\nalso rated the importance of healthcare trends and the role played by analytics\nin them.\n\n\n\nAnalytics is thus becoming very crucial in tracking different types of healthcare trends. Advanced analytics touches every aspect of\u00a0healthcare software systems\u00a0including clinical, operational and financial sectors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Role of Analytics in Transforming Healthcare\n\n\n\nHealthcare organizations have begun to adopt technologies like PACS imaging systems and EMRs or Electronic Health Records that attempts to make sense of the massive data that flows through the system (both structured and unstructured). Hence, it is important to know what are the tools that can extract information from the data to generate value and enjoy operational, financial and clinical insights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are genome analyzers and other analytics tools in the market that help in understanding the facts, and eliminate unwanted/useless details to extract only what\u2019s needed. The end result of this is better clinical outcomes for the patient. There are several ways in which healthcare organizations can make use of information collected through various sources.\n\n\n\nDisease Surveillance and Preventative ManagementDevelop Clinically Relevant and More Effective Diagnostic and Therapeutic TechniquesDevelopment of a Faster, Leaner, and More Productive R&D Pipeline\n\n\n\nExamples of business intelligence in healthcare\n\n\n\nThe following examples indicate successful applications,\nbuilt on a foundation of advanced analytical capabilities, in the healthcare\nindustry:\n\n\n\nUnityPoint Health in Iowa: managed to\u00a0reduce their risk-adjusted readmission rate by 40%\u00a0over the course of three years in one of their pilot hospitals by utilizing predictive modeling via Business Intelligence software.Washington State Health Care Authority:\u00a0reduced unnecessary ER visits\u00a0by implementing a Business Intelligence for the healthcare system to electronically integrate and distribute patient data across ER departments. Hospitals were able to identify patients who visited more frequently than others and share that patient\u2019s information with other hospitals. This resulted in an overall reduction of frequent ER visits by 10%, a decrease in visits by frequent ER patients by 10.7%, and scheduled prescription allocation decreased by 24%.\n\n\n\nPredictive analytics is key to enabling hospitals to\nproperly manage their readmission rates and sidestep costly penalties while\nsimultaneously addressing important aspects of patient treatment and care.\n\n\n\nAnalytics\u00a0are changing roles in the healthcare industry. \u00a0An increasing number of informed patients are taking more responsibility for their own care.\u00a0 Likewise, physicians are finding more satisfaction with their positions as positive effects increase.\u00a0 More time spent with individual patients has increased which gives physicians the chance to form a trusted relationship with the patient.\u00a0 Physicians want to spend time with their patients \u2013 to know them, interact with them, and help them.\u00a0 When the time to develop a relationship is diminished, the physician is less satisfied with his or her profession.\n\n\n\nAnalytics has\nchanged the way the healthcare world operates. \u00a0With the ability to\ntransform the way medicine has been practiced for years, analytics have\nresulted in improved health, reduction in diseases, and more satisfied patients\nand physicians.\n\n\n\nCombine artificial intelligence with data analysis\u00a0and\u00a0machine learning IoT, and it is easy to provide proactive care to patients. Hence, it would be a good move to invest in analytical solutions that can control and mitigate clinical and financial risks, with new payment bundles and models to go with it."
